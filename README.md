# WebScrapingAutoData
This project is part of the StretchAmbitionAdvanced project. This is connecting to an URL using Jsoup library and also extrating data from HTML pages content in order to take data about cars. As an outcome, this will end in an excel file containing interesting data about 40k cars. And using this file, the other project will upload it into a Spring context.
